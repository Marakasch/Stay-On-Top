My Fourth Game is a King Of the Hill Game without getting pushed from the Main Platform through enemies. 
I think, I spend the most time in this "Sandbox" environment for learning and creating new Features. 

Features I added to the Game: 
- Harder Enemies
- 2 new Power Ups (Shooting Homing Bullets and Jump and Smash down)
- Up & Down Floating Power Ups
- Particles for Shooting Bullets, also for Jumping Up and Smashing Down on the Ground
- A max spawn limit of 3 for each Power Up
- Different spawn Pattern for the FireUps(Shooting Bullets), JumpUps and Harder Enemies.
- Animation for my Halo Indicator before the Power Ups are expiring.
- You can only have one Power Up at the same time.
- Bigger Stage.
- A Wave Counter
- And Probably things I forgot to mention.

Enjoy the Rolling :D
